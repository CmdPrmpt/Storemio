Storemio

A powerful, terminal-based manager for your Stremio addon collections.

Storemio is a feature-rich, cross-platform TUI (Text-based User Interface) application built with Python. It's designed to give you complete control over your Stremio addon configurations across multiple accounts, offering features like profile mirroring, backups, and detailed addon management that go beyond the official Stremio app.
‚ú® Key Features

    üë§ Multi-Profile Management: Add and manage multiple Stremio accounts, each with its own isolated settings and addon collection.

    üîß Granular Addon Control: Go beyond simple installation with fine-tuned management:

        Reorder Addons: Change the priority of your entire addon list to control how content appears in Stremio.

        Advanced Catalog Management:

            Selectively enable or disable specific catalogs within any addon.

            Reorder the catalogs inside an addon to prioritize your preferred content sources.

        Rename & Clone: Give addons custom names for clarity and quickly copy any addon's configuration between your profiles.

    üîÑ Profile Mirroring: Designate a "master" profile. Storemio will automatically keep other "mirrored" profiles in perfect sync with the master's addon list, ideal for managing family accounts or multiple devices.

    üíæ Backup & Restore: Create timestamped snapshots of a profile's addon setup. You can easily restore a previous configuration at any time, protecting you from bad addon updates or accidental changes.

    üöÄ Integrated Stremio Launcher: Launch the Stremio Web UI in a dedicated window for any of your managed profiles directly from the app. Storemio automatically handles creating isolated browser profiles to keep your accounts separate.

    üíª Modern Terminal UI: A fast, responsive, and keyboard-driven interface built with curses that works great in modern terminals on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
